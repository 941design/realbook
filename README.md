# Realbook

A Realbook style collection of sheetmusic, created with lilypond.

## Design Goals

+ should not require any scripting or templating in addition to lilypond/guile
+ should look as neat as the classics
+ should be transposable (_TODO_)

## TODO

Pull requests welcome.

+ add LICENCE 
+ add single bar at beginning of each line
+ create score overlay underneath header as in /the/ Realbook
+ create toc and title page
+ substitute ./scores/all.ly by lisp function, collecting all scores in alphabetical order from ./scores directory
+ allow easy transposition of all scores
+ include source of each transcription in header/tagline if there are no legal issues with that
